# Dungeona
Dungeona is an infinite ASCII dungeon explorer built entirely in the terminal. It generates the world around you live as you move â€” like Minecraft, but in text. Every tile is rendered with expressive ASCII art, from trees and lava to traps and treasure. The game uses procedural chunk generation and supports real-time movement, exploration, and future combat.
